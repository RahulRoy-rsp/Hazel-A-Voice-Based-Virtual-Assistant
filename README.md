- Artificial intelligence driven programs or say virtual assistant are now used all over the world in our day to day life.
- In better understanding let’s say voice assistant because people do gets confused as virtual assistant could be any machine or can work according to the text or manually.
- So a voice based assistant can make people’s life very easy as they can do many things like playing music, videos or say search on the internet via various sources, just with a few voice commands.
- AI-powered voice assistants can break down barriers for people with disabilities, whether sensory, physical or cognitive.
- I have programmed Hazel in such a way that, a user can play music, search anything on Google.
- Also, they could search on Wikipedia and get their desired query results as appear on web browser and also can hear the contents of it via Hazel’s voice.
- Hazel can tweet on users twitter account, send email from users email address, open any social media sites, play music online as well as offline.
- Hazel can also translate any sentence or keyword give by user to their requested language.
- Hazel could lock the screen i.e turn on the sleep mode on when the user requests to lock the screen.
- All these can be done just by voice commands given by user.
